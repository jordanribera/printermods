# Pinned Micron Beefy Z Idlers

![Pinned BZI carriage model](images/pinned_micron_BZI_model.png)

I was trying out a modified version of BZI for micron that takes 3mm pins intead
of using a threaded screw to hold the idler bearings. Unfortunately the mounting
holes didn't align with the existing micron BZI body piece, so I cooked up this
version from scratch in FreeCAD.

I placed an M3 washer on either side of the bearing stack for a perfect centered fit.

Works with clee's [BZI](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI) (for micron).
